            <h1>How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
            <h3>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</h3>
            <p>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download</p>
            <p>You should already be familiar with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The basic functions and tools of Excel</li>
                <li>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</li>
                <li>Research design and how to identify independent variables and dependent variables</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research projects. After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
                <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
                <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Format data for analysis</h3>
            <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. 
                Open the document 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oFic8Mh2MLJrcKeostXoGZ7XIltF6Dzg/edit#gid=736119876" target="_blank">
                ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.</p>
                <p>In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.
                
                    <ol>
                        <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
                        <li>The first variable (in column A) is a unique identifier.</li>
                        <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters),
                            so change 4tutorial_types to tutorial_types.</li>
                        <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change use 
                            and useful to perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness, respectively.</li>
                        <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily
                            apparent that Column F refers to Perceived Usefulness and Column G refers 
                            to Perceived Ease of Use.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
             
                
                </p>
                
    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="illustrations/datalesson_fig3.png" alt="Figure 3" />
                        <figcaption>CAPTION: Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
                
                    </figure>
                    
                
                <p>Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In gender, change the "female" value to "F".</li>
                    <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example, tasks_completed values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add columns task1, task2, and task3, and reformat values appropriately.</li>
                    <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old tasks_completed column.</li>
                    <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>
            
                <p>Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the value is represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values dichotomous, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or correlations.</p>
                
                <p>Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document <a href="link_to_download_file.xls" target="_blank">ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed. In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column. Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</p>

                <aside>
                    <p><em>Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis. For example, separating experience levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low experience have perceived ease of use scores significantly different from those with medium and high experience levels.</em></p>
                </aside>

                <ol>
                    <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
                    <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with Insert > Columns for each distinct value in categorical data columns (tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, and task3). You do not have to add a new column for task1, task2, and task3 because their values are already dichotomous.</li>
                    <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values from the original column.</li>
                    <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: Edit > Replace.</li>
                    <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>

                        Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <em>perc_enjoy</em> is much higher on average than <em>perc_usefulness</em>, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.

                </aside>
                
                <p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and perc_ease_of_use are already adjacent.)
                Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to Tools > Add-Ins... and make sure Analysis ToolPak is checked. Click OK.</li>

                    <li>Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's Analyze menu, see if you can also find the following:</li>
                    <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
                    <li>Simple linear regression</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Select the perc_usefulness variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).</li>
                    <li>Select the free_play variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).</li>

                     output contains many numerical components 
                     (some of which must be cited in formal reports), it is a good idea to save it to a 
                     format independent of the PASW software. To save the results, go to File > Export. 
                     Change Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.),
                      then click OK.</p>
